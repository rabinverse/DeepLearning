        "Alan Shepard, aboard Freedom 7 on May 5, 1961, became the first American in space.\n",
        "What was Project Gemini?\n",
        "Project Gemini (1961–1966) tested spacecraft maneuvers and spacewalking techniques necessary for future Moon missions under the Apollo program.\n",
        "What was the goal of the Apollo Program?\n",
        "The Apollo Program (1961–1972) aimed to land humans on the Moon and return them safely to Earth — fulfilling President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 promise.\n",
        "Who were the first humans to land on the Moon?\n",
        "Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969, during Apollo 11. Armstrong’s quote: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”\n",
        "What caused the Apollo 1 tragedy?\n",
        "During a ground test in 1967, a cabin fire killed astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee due to an electrical fault in an oxygen-rich environment.\n",
        "What was the importance of Apollo 13?\n",
        "Apollo 13 (1970) suffered an oxygen tank explosion, but NASA engineers and the crew’s ingenuity brought them home safely — famously called a “successful failure.”\n",
        "What was Skylab?\n",
        "Skylab (1973–1979) was NASA’s first space station, used to study long-duration spaceflight effects on humans and conduct solar observations.\n",
        "What was the Space Shuttle Program?\n",
        "Launched in 1981, the Space Shuttle Program created reusable spacecraft for satellite launches, repairs, and scientific missions until 2011.\n",
        "What happened in the Challenger disaster?\n",
        "On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds after launch, killing all seven astronauts due to a failed O-ring seal in a solid rocket booster.\n",
        "What was the Columbia disaster?\n",
        "On February 1, 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated upon re-entry because of a damaged thermal protection tile caused by foam strike during launch.\n",
        "What is the Hubble Space Telescope and why is it important?\n",
        "Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope provided deep-space images, revealing the age of the universe, the existence of dark energy, and stunning galaxies and nebulae.\n",
        "What is the International Space Station (ISS)?\n",
        "The ISS, operational since 2000, is a multinational space laboratory orbiting Earth, jointly built by NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA, supporting long-term microgravity research.\n",
        "What was the Mars Rover Spirit and Opportunity’s mission?\n",
        "Launched in 2003, Spirit and Opportunity were twin rovers sent to explore Mars’ surface. Opportunity lasted nearly 15 years, discovering signs of past water.\n",
